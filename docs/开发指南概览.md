The core developers of PlatON are developing more and more tools to help community developers build, test and deploy their applications. And we also launched the PlatON DevNetwork, welcome community developers to provide passion, innovation and diversified ideas to enhance the development experience.



#### [Community Grant Projects' Introduction](/docs/en/community/ )。



#### Technical Features of PlatON:

PlatON was initiated and promoted by the LatticeX Foundation. Based on the basic properties of the blockchain and supported by a privacy-preserving computing network, PlatON provides the next-generation Internet basic protocol with "computing interoperability" as its core feature. PlatON builds a computing system jointly assembled by cryptographic algorithms such as verifiable computing, secure multi-party computing, zero-knowledge proof, homomorphic encryption, and blockchain technology to provide public infrastructure under an open source architecture for global artificial intelligence, distributed application developers, data providers and various institutions, communities and individuals with computing needs.



[1、EVM&Solidity Contract](/docs/en/Solidity_Dev_Manual)

EVM is a Lightweight Virtual Machine used to run Solidity SmartContract on PlatON network. You can develop Solidity Contract by solidity language and build it to solc bin to run. Transactions that trigger the Solidity Contract are packaged by the consensus node, and verificated on all network nodes. State of Solidity Contract is saved in public ledger.



[2、WASM&WASM Contract](/docs/en/PlatON_Overall_Solution#smart-contract)

The PlatON network uses [wagon](https://github.com/go-interpreter/wagon) as another smart contract virtual machine for PlatON. As a virtual machine of PlatON, it needs to be modified. Realize the external functions on the chain and the calculation method of GAS. Wasm contracts support more high-level language development, and they are eventually compiled into wasm for execution.



[3、Privacy-Preserving Computing](/docs/en/Secure_Multi_Party_Computation#introduction-to-mpc)

PlatON implements a privacy contract solution based on a secure multi-party computing cryptographic algorithm. The main idea is to publish the private computing algorithm through a contract, and the data provider and computing nodes that require privacy protection will cooperate to execute the MPC protocol to achieve data Collaborative computing



4、[Account Model]()

PlatON chooses mature and stable account models that support smart contracts. In PlatON, each account has a state associated with it and a 20-byte address. There are two types of accounts:

- Ordinary account：Controlled by the private key, users can generate it through the wallet client or the command line. In PlatON, ordinary accounts can create transactions and use private keys to sign transactions.

- Contract account：There is no private key, it is controlled by code, and the contract account address is generated when the contract is deployed. Unlike ordinary accounts, contract accounts cannot initiate new transactions on their own. Whenever a contract account receives a message, the code inside the contract is activated, allowing it to read and write to internal storage, and send other messages or create a contract.

  

[5、Consensus mechanism](/docs/en/PlatON_Solution#summary)

PlatON uses a BFT-like PoS mechanism. PlatON consensus operation is divided into 3 stages.

   1: The Election of Alternative Validators；2: The Selection of Validators by the VRF；3: Validators Run CBFT



[6、Economic Solution](/docs/en/Economic_Model#platons-economic-design-goals)

PlatON's economic design has the following goals:

First, choose PoS. We believe that PoW's energy consumption is too high. Faced with real-world energy constraints, PoW's market share cannot grow indefinitely. PlatON's consensus algorithm is called PPoS (PlatON PoS).

Second, reduce consensus costs. PPoS uses off-chain identity and credit mechanisms and programmatic arrangements, but reduces the reliance on them through the randomness introduced by VRF. This can effectively suppress bribery and collusion.

Third, strengthen the coupling relationship between the economic activities in the public blockchains and the economic activities supported by the public blockchain (that is, data and computing power circulation markets) to provide support for the value of the token.

Fourth, endogenously inhibit the expansion of the PPoS mining pool.



[7、Governance Mechanism](/docs/en/PlatON_Governance_Solution#platon-governance-mechanism)

In PlatON governance, we have adopted a combination of direct and indirect democracy. Its core principles are: in the normal state, voting by the validator, that is, indirect democracy; under major differences, voting by the community, which is direct democracy.



[8、GAS](/docs/en/Economic_Model#transaction-fees)

Every application running on Platon consumes resources (computing power, bandwidth, storage, data, etc.).In order to realize the fair and reasonable use of resources and avoid the abuse of resources, the GAS mechanism of Ethereum is adopted to realize the reasonable scheduling and validity verification of resources.



In this article, I focus on the guidelines that Platon developers are interested in

[1、Setting up the development environment](/docs/en/Install_PlatON)；

[2、PlatON Development Network；](/docs/en/Become_PlatON_Dev_Verification)

[3、Receive Test Token](https://luo-dahui.github.io/docs/en/PlatON_Dev_Faucet)；

[4、Node Tools Guide；](/docs/en/OnLine_MTool_Manual )

[5、Development  WASM/JVM；](/docs/en/EVM_Smart_Contract )

[6、API and SDK documentation。]( /docs/en/Java_SDK )



Before you start using the Platon development network, you should note the following:

1、The development network is only used for development and testing;

2、There is no value in developing online tokens, so please pay attention to fraud;

3、The development network will be reset and updated based on the development status, so all tokens or states on the chain will be cleared after the Platon development network is reset.



#### TOKEN STANDARDS：

1、[PRC 20](/docs/en/Solidity_Contract_Dev_Costs#large-sized-contract)：A standard interface for alternative (interchangeable) tokens, such as voting tokens, betting tokens, or virtual currencies.Platon introduces the standard for replaceable tokens that make each token exactly the same (in type and value) as another token, meaning that one token will always be equal to all other tokens.



2、PRC 721：A standard interface for non-homogeneous tokens, such as art contracts or songs.PRC-721 introduces this standard for NFT, where this type of token is unique on the chain and may have a different value from another token from the same smart contract due to other reasons such as its age, rarity, or even its visual effect.



3、Privacy Token ：Privacy TOKEN contract is based on the Alaya WASM intelligence platform [PIP-13](https://github.com/AlayaNetwork/AIPs/blob/master/Alaya/AIP-13.md) tokens project proposal to build privacy.The project is intended to address the growing need for anonymity of transactions.The zero-knowledge proof algorithm achieves identity concealment, and the algorithm is plug-in to meet various privacy requirements.Support the independent issuance of privacy tokens and privatization of PRC20 assets;Using the plug-in mechanism, the algorithm can be upgraded online and the user can be upgraded without feeling.
